# Classification Summary:
With an objective to mitigate risk of defaults, various machine learning models were built & evaluated to predict credit risk using machine learning techniques in the Credit Risk Ensemble exercise.  Splitting the testing & training data to check the target values then scaling the features data as part of the data pre-processing procedure was a vital part of the process facilitating RFC & EEC. Utilizing Random Forest (RFC) and Easy Ensemble (EEC) classifiers it was determined that Random Forest had the best accuracy score as well as recall & geometric mean scores with overall top 3 features being total_bal_ex_mort, mo_sin_old_rev_tl_op & loan_amnt.  In order to assess accuracy, recall, etc. it was important to apply a simple logistic regression model, calculate balanced accuracy score, display confusion matrix then generate an imbalanced classification report across over & under sampling algorithms. It was discovered that SMOTE Oversampling and Undersampling have the best accuracy scores. Combo (Over and Under) Sampling appear to have best recall score. Combo (Over and Under) Sampling appear to have best geometric mean score.  Both exercises (i.e., Credit Risk Ensemble & Credit Risk Resampling) utilized sklearn to perform these functions and give evidence to effective and ineffective classifiers and sampling algorithms.
