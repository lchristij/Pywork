# Classification Summary:
With an objective to mitigate risk of defaults, various machine learning models were built & evaluated to predict credit risk using machine learning techniques in the Credit Risk Ensemble exercise.  Splitting the testing & training data to check the target values then scaling the features data as part of the data pre-processing procedure was a vital part of the process facilitating RFC & EEC. Utilizing Random Forest (RFC) and Easy Ensemble (EEC) classifiers it was determined that EEC had the best accuracy score as well as recall scores with overall top 3 features being total_rec_prncp, total_pymnt & total_pymnt_inv.  In order to assess accuracy, recall, etc. it was important to apply a simple logistic regression model, calculate balanced accuracy score, display confusion matrix then generate an imbalanced classification report across over & under sampling algorithms. It was discovered that Ramdom, SMOTE Under & combo have the best accuracy scores. Recall & geometric mean scores were about even across the board.  Both exercises (i.e., Credit Risk Ensemble & Credit Risk Resampling) utilized sklearn to perform these functions and give evidence to effective and ineffective classifiers and sampling algorithms.
